# CVNT: Activity Booking API

A full-stack **Next.js** application providing a robust API for managing and booking activities, complete with user authentication, role-based access control, and booking validation.

This project was built as part of a Backend Assignment using **Next.js API routes**, **MongoDB/Mongoose**, and **JWT-based authentication**.

## üõ† Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Next.js | Full-stack framework (API routes) |
| MongoDB & Mongoose | Database and ODM for storing users, activities, and bookings |
| JWT | Token-based authentication & authorization |
| Bcrypt | Password hashing for security |
| Tailwind CSS | Basic frontend styling |

---

## ‚úÖ Features

### Authentication
- **Register** (`POST /api/auth/register`)
- **Login** (`POST /api/auth/login`)  
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT tokens generated on login for session management.

### Activities (Admin Only)
- **CRUD operations**:
  - `GET /api/activity` ‚Äì List all activities (public)
  - `GET /api/activity/[id]` ‚Äì Single activity details (public)
  - `POST /api/activity/[id]` ‚Äì Create activity
  - `PUT /api/activity/[id]` ‚Äì Update activity
  - `DELETE /api/activity/[id]` ‚Äì Delete activity  
- Only users with `isadmin: true` can create, update, or delete activities.

### Bookings (Authenticated Users)
- **Book an activity** (`POST /api/booking`)
- **List user bookings** (`GET /api/booking/me`)  
- Validations:
  - Prevents double booking
  - Checks activity capacity
  - Requires JWT authentication

### Error Handling
- Returns proper HTTP status codes for all API errors (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`).

SECRET="YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
```

### Running Locally

### Authentication
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Create new user |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Login user and receive JWT |

### Activities
| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/activity` | Public | List all activities |
| GET | `/api/activity/[id]` | Public | Get single activity |
| POST | `/api/activity/[id]` | Admin | Create activity |
| PUT | `/api/activity/[id]` | Admin | Update activity |
| DELETE | `/api/activity/[id]` | Admin | Delete activity |

### Bookings
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/booking` | Book an activity (requires login) |
| GET | `/api/booking/me` | List logged-in user‚Äôs bookings |

---

## üìò Testing
You can use **Postman** to test all endpoints. Import the collection from the `cvnt.postman_collection.json` file included in this repo. Make sure to include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

---

## üîê Notes
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt.  
- JWT is used for all authenticated routes.  
- Admin privileges required for activity CRUD operations.  
- Bookings check for double booking and capacity limits.
